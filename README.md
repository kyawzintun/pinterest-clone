# Free Code Camp - Pinterest Clone
Pinterest Clone is my solution to a Free Code Camp full stack project challenge, [Build a Pinterest Clone](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pinterest-clone).

## Getting started

Once you clone the repo you can run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

App should now be running on [localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500/).
